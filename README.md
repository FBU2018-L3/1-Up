## Required User Stories:

## Optional User Stories:
- Users can connect their facebook or other social media accounts to see their friends on the application
...Friends can send each other bonuses or complete activities together and record it, gaining more experience points than they would if they completed the activity by themselves
- The kindle library can be synced to the app, tracking the time and the amount of words read to award experience points under the reading activity accordingly.
- Users can allow the app to see their location to gain experience points depending on whether or not they are at a registered location.
- "Sleep mode" can track battery usage/app usage to determine whether the user is actively using the mobile device and pause the sleep timer accordingly.
- Users can input their own activities, with app text recognition being able to decipher intent and assign experience points accordingly.

## Typical Character Narrative
*User:* **Chad** is a college student who doesn't feel productive with his time.

> He may enter some numerical details and, behind the scenes, a number of experience points are awarded to the users.
> His awarded experience points are added to his progress bar. If the progress bar is filled up, **Chad** will "level up".

**Chad** goes to his profile:
> He sees a feed of his most recently recorded activities and the experience points he was awarded for them.
> He also sees his progress bar (experience bar), his progress towards to his next level, and any earned rewards.

**Chad** is going to bed:
> **Chad** opens the app and toggles the sleep button on the app.
> He puts his phone down and goes to sleep.
> **Chad** wakes up and toggles the button on the app again.
> The app calculates the number of hours slept, the earned experience points, and then adds them to his progress (experience) bar.
